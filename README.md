# Dominant Color Extraction Dominance and Recoloring

A Python program to extract the dominant colors of an image and visualize their
dominance using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The program then regenerates
the image using the dominant colors identified as K centers.

## Dependencies

-  OpenCV-Python
-  Numpy
-  Matplotlib
-  Scipy
-  Sklearn

## Requirements

To run this program, you will need either:

1. **Jupyter Notebook** installed on your system, or
2. **Jupyter extension in VS Code** for running `.ipynb` files.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`dominant_color_extraction.ipynb`) using
   either Jupyter Notebook or the Jupyter extension in VS Code.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to process your images.

## About

This project was developed to explore the use of K-Means clustering in color
extraction and image recoloring.
